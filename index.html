        <h1>My Wife<br/>The love of my life.</h1>
        <p>We were just sixteen when we found each other.
        From the very beginning, I was hooked on you—like casting a fishing line and waiting for that perfect catch. And when you finally bit, boom—the hook was set. I knew you'd fall for my stupid self eventually.</p>
        <p>Okay, five years? Seriously, what took you so long!? (Just kidding… kind of.)</p>
        <p>But in all seriousness, we talked every single day.
        FaceTime calls, snaps, Instagram videos—half the time it was all at once. We couldn’t get enough of each other. Then, out of the blue, life surprised us with something even more beautiful: our baby boy.</p>
        <p>That test turned positive, and just like that, everything changed. I dropped out of school, got kicked out, and hit the ground running to provide for us. From that moment on, we weren’t just a couple—we were a family.</p>
        <p>We built something more powerful than love. A lifelong bond.
        We scraped together what little we had and got our own apartment. It wasn’t much, but to us, it was everything. A home, a haven, a dream come true. We were on cloud nine, making a life for our little family even though we were still so young.</p>
        <p>But life doesn’t always stay perfect.
        Almost a year later, we faced the hardest test of our relationship.
        We fought. A lot. We hurt each other with words, with silence. You left.
        I spiraled—drugs, alcohol… it all took hold.</p>
        <p>We lost everything.
        The car. The apartment. Custody of our son.
        But you know what we didn’t lose? Each other.</p>
        <p>We got our shit together. We crawled out of that dark place, hand in hand. Not for anyone else—for us. Because deep down, no matter how broken we were, we still wanted to be a family. It was always us against the world.</p>
        <p>Then came the news: our perfect baby girl.
        She was the light in our storm, the proof that we were meant to be. A second chance. A sign from the universe that we were on the right path.</p>
        <p>Now we’ve got two little versions of ourselves running wild in this world.
        And honestly? It’s terrifying.
        We just want them to grow up safer, happier, and more loved than we ever were. We want them to never feel the fear, the pain, the uncertainty we did.</p>
        <p>And today—Mother’s Day—is about you.
        I wish I could give you the world. I wish I had more to offer than just this story, this love letter. But for now, this is what I have: my heart, my words, my promise.</p>
        <p>We don’t have it all, but we have each other.
        We’re still struggling, but we're stronger now.
        Hand in hand. Us versus the world.
        Not just for you. Not just for me. But for our family.</p>
        <p>You are the most incredible woman I’ve ever known.
        My best friend. My ride or die.
        I never want to lose you again.</p>
        <p>And if I had to? I’d burn this whole damn world to the ground…
        Then piss on the ashes and plant your favorite flowers right in the dirt.</p>
        <p>I love you. I appreciate you.
        Thank you for being everything.</p>
        <p>Happy Mother’s Day. I hope this was good enough.
        Next year—I’ll make it perfect.</p>
        <p><strong>Forever your best friend.</strong></p>
